The vast territory that makes up the US and Canada is a place of mythic journeys, eye-boggling scenery, and – beyond those headline-grabbing, culture-dominating cities – raw wilderness.\n\nThe US National Parks Service oversees nearly 400 protected areas, including Yellowstone (the oldest) and Alaska’s Wrangell St-Elias (the biggest; larger than Switzerland). And north of the 49th parallel, Canada has endless emptiness, home to wolf, bear and moose, much of which can only be accessed by floatplane.\n\nSo, given the scale of the place, your first thought should be how to get around. Domestic flights are extensive and affordable (particularly if you buy an air pass), but for romance and views stick at ground level. Hire a car or a campervan, ride the Greyhound bus or take the Amtrak railway (in the US) or VIA Rail (in Canada) for a days-long trundle between cities.\n\nSome of the best journeys are offshore, too: the ferry journey through Alaska’s Inside Passage is a gold-rush history lesson and whale-watching extravaganza rolled into one.\n\nOnce you’ve got your transport sorted, pick your highlights. You’d need months to scratch the surface of the whole continent, so instead focus on a big trip (coast to coast, Route 66, California’s Pacific Coast Highway) or a region (the Great Lakes; the ‘Four Corners’ region of the Southwest; Vancouver and the Canadian West). North America may be all about big journeys, but don’t forget to stop and linger too.\n\nFinally, try to meet some of North America’s indigenous people. In the southern US, Native American traditions are alive and well (try New Mexico). In Canada, there’s an increasing variety of First Nations experiences from homestays to Inuit-led wildlife cruises. Their insights prove there’s far more to North American culture than Hollywood and Broadway.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Start planning your trip to North America today...\n\n## Further Reading\n\n### Top 10 North American travel experiences\n\nIt would take a lifetime to do proper justice to the variety of experiences on offer in North America, but here are a few ideas for starters\n\n__1. Take a great rail journey__ – rail travel is one of the best ways to see great swaths of North America breezing past (many of the trains even have special transparent-roofed viewing carriages for better sightseeing): you're only limited by the amount of time you have. Try an Amtrak or VIA Rail pass for the best value. \\\n__2. Watch polar bears, Churchill, Manitoba__ – in the remote, frozen town of Churchill, Canada, nestled on the shores of Hudson Bay, having a good bear story to tell counts for a lot. The good news is it is pretty hard to leave without one of your own. Take to the tundra in a big-wheeled buggy in October/November for the best chance of a sighting. \\\n__3. Hike the gold-rush trail, Yukon__ – hike along the Klondike River near Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. About 390 tons of the yellow stuff have been taken from the Klondike area in the century since its discovery – it's worth having a go and panning for some of your own. \\\n__4. Experience New York State__ – hike or climb in the Catskills; canoe, kayak, raft and camp as you explore the Finger Lakes; nip into the wineries – there's more to the state than that big city. Though a stop-off in the Big Apple is fun too! \\\n__5. Ride Alaska’s Marine Highway__ – Alaska's Marine Highway is a lifeline for remote coastal communities – luckily, it is also the best way to see Alaska's rugged wilderness, scenic beauty and abundant wildlife as the ferries run up the Inside Passage and out to the Aleutian Islands. \\\n__6. Cycle Canada’s Gulf Islands__ – try pedal-powered island-hopping on the southern, Canadian section of the bohemian Gulf Islands archipelago: Saltspring, Pender, Saturna, Mayne and Galiano islands await. \\\n__7. Explore Arctic wilderness, Nunavut, Canada__ – Nunavut is a land so vast and harsh that few people have even dared to explore it. Visit Nunavut and witness how the Inuit have thrived for centuries in harmony with the extreme conditions and rugged landscape. \\\n__8. Gawp at the Grand Canyon, Arizona__ – stare, open-mouthed as nearly two billion years of geological history lays exposed at your feet. Stand on the rim for great vistas, or hike down into the canyon, camp at the bottom and hike out the next day. Perhaps the ultimate trip: raft the length of the Colorado River for the true insider's view. \\\n__9. Camp with wolves, Isle Royale NP__ – one of the USA's remote national parks is a great place to camp out and listen for wolves at night as they call to each other across the island. \\\n__10. Discover wild Hawaii__ – the USA's Pacific-marooned state is more than themed aloha-luaus: hike lava fields and volcanos, and spot dolphins, whales and sea turtles, wild deer and boar when you get off the beaten track. \\",

The mighty Andes support the world’s highest capital city (La Paz), as well as the highest mountain (6,962m Aconcagua) and highest railway (from Lima to Huancayo) outside Asia.\n\nFor culture vultures Mexico and the compact countries of Central America are the heartlands of the Maya and Aztec civilisations, and Maya sites such as Chichen Itza (Mexico), Tikal (Guatemala) and Copan (Honduras) retain the power to thrill – despite high tourist numbers.\n\nFurther south there are also myriad opportunities to meet today’s tribal groups in Amazon ecolodges, offering a fascinating insight into the rainforest, an often surprising level of comfort, and, when well-managed, a viable economic future for marginalised people.\n\nFor walkers, Peru and Patagonia are classic destinations. The trek to the Inca city of Machu Picchu (Latin America’s biggest tourist draw) heads a long list of Peruvian trails combining stunning scenery and ancient cultures. In Chile, the jagged peaks of Torres Del Paine are the iconic image of Patagonia, the southern wilderness shared with Argentina.\n\nFor wildlife enthusiasts, the most bio-diverse area of the planet awaits, with Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia all offering access to the mighty Amazon. But many other parks or areas best the Amazon for actual sightings: try Brazil’s Pantanal or Guyana’s Iwokrama for jaguar; Mexico’s Baja peninsula for whales and whale sharks; Central America for birds; the Galapagos Islands for, well, extremely close encounters.\n\nIf you’ve got a few months to spare, Latin America is a thrilling region to explore overland. Travellers on the ‘gringo trail’ frequently start in the sophisticated cities of Rio or Buenos Aires, or work their way south from Mexico City.\n\nLocal transport is variable: the overcrowded ‘chicken bus’ and ramshackle pickups remain stalwarts; trains are few but spectacular. Flights are an increasingly popular way of handling some of the huge distances involved (Brazil alone is 35 times bigger than the UK), but remain expensive.\n\nWherever you’re going, two useful resources are the Latin American Travel Association (LATA) – whose members comprise the UK’s leading Latin American tour operators – and the South American Explorers Club, which offers independent travel advice and friendly clubhouses in Lima, Cusco, Quito and Buenos Aires.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Start planning your Latin American adventure today…\n\n# Further Reading\n### Top 10 Latin America experiences\n\nGreat treks to lost cities, wildlife that nibbles your shoelaces, the world's biggest raiinforest (by far) and colourfully crumbling colonial splendour – Latin America has something to suit everyone\n\n1. __Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, Peru__ – Latin America’s biggest draw is over-visited but still overwhelming. Book early to ensure you get a place on the classic Inca Trail, or consider one of the quieter alternative routes.\n2. __Explore the Galapagos, Ecuador__ – Darwin’s wildlife wonderland shows evolution in action, and offers extremely up-close wildlife encounters with frollicking sea lions, scaly iguanas, giant tortoises and a range of curious birds (don't miss the courtship dances of both the albatross and the blue-footed booby).\n3. __Go jaguar-spotting, Brazil__ – the Pantanal wetland is simply the cat’s whiskers: it's one of very few places where jaguar are regularly spotted, along with a whole host of other wildlife. August and September are the peak months for big cat sightings.\n4. __Hike the wilds of Patagonia__ – a travel word to conjure with, Patagonia is a sweeping land of lakes, rock spires and wilderness, offering fantastic trekking. The Torres del Paine Circuit is a classic, though other options abound. Try northern Patagonia to escape the crowds.\n5. __Riding the rails, South America__ – the Devil’s Nose, the Train to the Clouds – the names of the continent's rail routes say it all. The trains here are more scenic spectaculars than a means to get around: there are few services, but those that do exist offer world-class experiences.\n6. __Whale-watch in Baja California, Mexico__ – a bounty of marine riches: in winter the Pacific coast of this peninsula is home to pretty much the entire population of grey whales, while the Sea of Cortez, on Baja's east, is a sheltered calving ground for fin, sperm, humpback and even blue whales; the best time for blues is January to March.\n7. __Follow the Maya Route, Guatemala__ – a museum in the rainforest: trek into the jungle of Guatemala for an Indiana Jones adventure. Pyramids such as Tikal are well excavated; for a more rugged adventure head for little-visited and rainforest-hidden El Mirador.\n8. __Experience Carnival, Brazil__ – Rio gets the headlines, but the February/March street parades in Salvador and Recife get the connoisseurs: expect samba moves, exuberant costumes and a real locals' party.\n9. __Fall for Cartagena, Colombia__ – this Unesco-listed, coastal gem of a city has deservedly put Colombia back on the map; wander the pastel-coloured streets and soak up the ambiance. Visit in January for the Hay Literary Festival.\n10. __Salar de Uyuni salt flats, Bolivia__ – this high-altitude, incredibly flat and vastly spreading salt pan is one of the world's weirdest places. Stay at a hotel made of salt blocks, meet the resident flamingoes and go on a (long) drive to appreciate the scale.",

        "descriptionText": " ## Overview\n\nEurope travel advice, including top 10 European travel tips, map of Europe, guide to European city breaks, rail journeys in Europe and where to stay in Europe.\n\nFrom the classical rubble of Athens and Rome to the castles of southern Spain, the pomp of Victorian London to the vineyards of Champagne, the ideas and institutions of Europe have spread to every corner of the world.\n\nNowhere has such a density of iconic, art-and-architecture-packed cities. Barcelona, Granada, Venice, Palermo, Paris, Avignon… between them Spain, France and Italy could easily fill a year of weekend breaks. And for longer stays, there are numerous historic regions to explore at leisure: the Moorish towns of Andalucia in Spain; the Renaissance cities of northern Italy; the Loire Valley chateaux in France.\n\nBut Europe has its wild side too. The great mountain chain of the Alps is the birthplace of world climbing, and Switzerland and Austria lay claim to breathtaking scenery criss-crossed by hiking trails. Norway’s fjords are truly epic and (outside the peak summer cruising season) remarkably quiet. North of the Artic Circle, Lapland offers husky sledding, Sami culture and the much-imitated Ice Hotel. Scotland’s Highlands and Islands has vast sweeps of moor, forest and crag; Iceland and southern Italy are dominated by volcanoes; Almeria in southern Spain even has a desert.\n\nSouthern Europe is defined by the balmy Mediterranean Sea, and its coastal towns and islands are where package tourism made some of its biggest mistakes – and started to learn from them. Islands like Tenerife, Malta, Ibiza, Mallorca, Corfu and Cyprus all have interesting hinterlands away from the resort strips, and reward exploration.\n\nThe former Soviet countries of Eastern Europe are catching up fast with the neighbours – and, outside the Euro currency, benefiting from lower prices. With its plethora of Adriatic islands, Croatia is already well-established as an alternative to Greece. Romania, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine harbour bears, wolves and untrammelled rural landscapes; the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have historic cities (and great saunas). On the Soviet front line, Germany’s capital Berlin has now been reunited for 20 years, and repeatedly tops ‘favourite city’ lists.\n\nPerhaps the best way to explore Europe is by rail. This is a continent of relatively small countries, and you can whisk from big city to mountain to coast – and on to a whole new country – in a few hours. Inter-rail (for European citizens only) and Eurail passes (for others) give access to 30 countries, and have kick-started many great travelling lives. For UK residents, Rail Europe has fares, routes and passes.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Start planning your European adventure today…\n\n## Further Reading\n\n### Top 10 Europe travel experiences\n\nFrom mountain ranges to turquoise seas, from really old ruins to throbbing modern cities, Europe has enough to keep every traveller entertained for a lifetime\n\n1. __Explore volcanic landscapes, Iceland__ – Iceland is a hotbed of geothermal activity: geysers spew, volcanoes erupt, hot pools steam. You can see a lot from capital Reykjavik – take a dip in the Blue Lagoon, then a day trip to Geysir and Gulfoss. Longer treks will unearth innumerable volcanic treasures.\n2. __Marvel at the Alhambra, Granada, Spain__ – the Moorish palace and fortress complex that dominates the Andalucian city is a delight of courtyards, pools and ornate chambers. It gets busy though – a good guide will steer you away from the crowds.\n3. __Cruise Norway’s fjords__ – the Unesco-listed inlets of the Norwegian coast are as dramatic as they are far-reaching, stretching way up into the Arctic Circle. Board the Hurtigruten ferry, which runs from north to south and back again year round, to see the lot.\n4. __Island hop, Greece__ – there are over 6,000 Greek islands, which is a lot of hopping. Try Santorini for romance, Crete for ruins and gorges, the Ionian Islands for learning to sail, and all of them for breezy taverna lounging.\n5. __Roaming the Highlands, Scotland__ – head to the UK's far north for the country's wildest wilderness and profuse wildlife: take binoculars to look out for puffins (try the Stacks of Duncansby), golden eagles, otters in the rivers, dolphins offshore (head to Moray Firth) and red squirrels in the woods.\n6. __Cycling in France__ – the perfect place for pedalers of all abilities: pros can tackle stretches of the Tour de France (the slog up Mont Ventoux, perhaps) while more casual cyclists can ride along the Loire or Brittany's coast, stopping off for plenty of vin rouge en route.\n7. __Meet bears and wolves, Romania__ – the Carpathian Mountains are one of the best spots for big mammals on the continent. Trek across this little-populated region with a local guide to maximise your chances of a sighting.\n8. __Hike round the Eiger, Switzerland__ – you don't need to summit this mighty mountain; for the best views of all its faces, walk around it instead, stopping in Heidi-cute hamlets and wildflower meadows. The excellent and efficient Swiss transport system makes access a doddle.\n9. __See Old Europe, Sicily, Italy__ – combine an active volcano, craggy coves, sunny beaches, top nosh and a surplus of ancient ruins on this Italian island, which has a distinctly differently feel to the mainland. Just avoid August, when all of Italy goes on holiday.\n10. __Walk the South West Coast Path, England__ – 1,000km of undulating, sea-hugging, seal-dotted, pasty-serving loveliness: England's longest walking trail is a beauty. In summer look out for basking sharks passing by.",

        "descriptionText": "Overview\nAsia travel advice, including top 10 Asia travel experiences, map of Asia, guide to travel in Asia, what to do in Asia and when to go to Asia\n\nLow living costs, fascinating Buddhist cultures and easy-going rural lifestyles make Southeast Asia and India classic destinations for independent travellers, and the recent boom in regional airlines make travelling around these regions increasingly swift. The neighbouring countries of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are often visited on one itinerary, frequently combined with traveller-friendly Thailand.\n\nFor walkers, the mighty Himalaya mountains arc through Asia, sheltering little-visited mountain kingdoms and providing world-class treks in Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet (China), Pakistan, and northern India.\n\nFor wildlife enthusiasts, Asia offers the chance to see three of the world’s most iconic threatened species: the tiger, the panda and the orang utan. Beyond these flagship species, the teeming rainforests of Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the island of Borneo harbour species still unknown to science, as well as opportunities to meet and stay with Asia’s hunter-gatherer tribes.\n\nCulture vultures are spoiled for choice too, with two of the world’s oldest civilisations – China and Japan – showcasing their rich pasts but also, in their buzzing, 24-hour cities, pointing to the future. It is hard to pick from Asia's architectural marvels: the Taj Mahal and Angkor Wat are just two.\n\nLooking for downtime? Asia also boasts more than its fair share of tropical beaches – ideal for snorkelling and diving. Pricey but postcard-perfect, the Indian Ocean islands of The Maldives are a classic honeymoon destination, while nearby Sri Lanka offers greater diversity and better value. Further east, take your pick from the thousands of beach-fringed islands of Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nMany first-time visitors to Asia worry about health issues, but in reality, providing you take reasonable sensible precautions, few travellers suffer more than an upset stomach. And for many, good health is the very reason for a visit: throughout Asia, natural healing techniques and Buddhist philosophies are combined in some of the world’s most relaxing and rejuvenating body and soul experiences.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Start planning your Asian adventure today…\n\n__Further Reading__\nTop 10 Asia travel experiences\nA mesmerising mix of religions, cuisines and cultures, Asia has something to offer every traveller. Try these for starters\n\n1. Ride the Trans Siberian Railway, Russia – this epic, six-day train ride from Moscow to Beijing or Vladivostok is the best way to see Siberia. Pack a good book and prepare to drink a lot of tea and vodka with your carriage-mates: outside your window Europe turns into Asia.\n2. Visit Luang Prabang, Laos – this laidback town on the banks of the Mekong River is travellers' heaven: see orange-robed monks wandering amid the temples, shop for local crafts, take a cookey class and then eat the spoils with a cold Beer Lao.\n3. Stay in a tribal longhouse, Borneo – gain an insight into tribal life by bedding down with a local family in their traditional home; a stay will likely include homecooking, jungle walks and a bit of a sing song.\n4. Take a city break in Istanbul, Turkey – East meets West, Europe meets Asia: the Bosphorus, which runs through Istanbul, divides the continents in this most fascinating of places.\n5. Trek to Everest Base Camp, Nepal – the summit might be for only a few hardy (and wealthy) mountaineers, but anyone with an ounce of fitness can tackle the spectacular trek to the base of the world's highest mountain.\n6. See the Taj Mahal, India – true love sculpted in marble, this impossibly romantic mausoleum is a travel great: get up pre-dawn to see it before the crowds arrive.\n7. Cruise the backwaters, Kerala – take to an old rice barge and float along the languid waterways of southern India. Dine on divine veggie food, watch fishermen cast their nets and generally let life pass you by.\n8. Meet a panda, China – though increasingly rare, you can still spot pandas: for guaranteed sightings, head to the research centre in Chengdu; for more adventure (and the chance of a wild encounter) trek into Sichuan's Qinling Mountains.\n9. Explore Angkor, Cambodia – this temple complex is vast. Do wander the central structures of Angkor Wat and see the big stone heads of the Bayon temple, but allow time to explore the outer (and less-visited) sites to add adventure.\n10. Cruise Halong Bay, Vietnam – board a traditional junk boat and float amid the karst islands and fishing communities of northern Vietnam. Adrenalin junkies can try a range of activities too, including world-class rock climbing.",

But there’s far more to the continent than the nature documentary view, and different African regions have their own particular appeal...\n\nHow long to spend in Africa\nIf you’ve got time on your hands, you can’t beat a top-to-bottom odyssey. Cairo to Cape Town is the classic overlanding route, which takes about twenty weeks, but there are all sorts of variations.\n\nA month allows you to get a feel for the African way of life, and explore two or three countries – perhaps combine some wildlife viewing with trekking and coastal downtime. If time is really tight, focus your sights on one destination and don’t try to pack too much in: weather conditions, accessibility and laid-back attitudes can play havoc with gruelling schedules.",

So now the world knows what visitors knew all along – that these two little-and-large neighbours pack in more adventure, natural wonder and (breathe it) cultural wallop than almost anywhere else on earth. Add in the 7,500 beguiling isles of the South Pacific – from the enigmatic big heads of Easter Island to the land-divers of Vanuatu – and you have a traveller-friendly region with enormous depth and variety. The classic first-timer’s tour of Australia – ‘Sydney, Rock and Reef’ – ticks off its world icons: the feelgood harbour city, the jaw-dropping desert monolith of Uluru (Ayers Rock), and the divers’ paradise of the Great Barrier Reef. Many equally rewarding experiences lie further afield. though. Western Australia offers true wilderness adventures in the outback; Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory, is perhaps the best place to learn about Aboriginal culture; and Tasmania boasts world class rafting, hiking and rainforest. New Zealanders like to call their home ‘God’s Own Country’, and for anyone with a taste for outdoors, they’re probably right. The larger, craggier South Island often grabs the headlines, but the North Island is quieter and no less beautiful. Take your pick from fjord-lined Milford Sound, the coastal Abel Tasman and Queen Charlotte tracks, the volcanic Tongariro Crossing – and dozens more hiking gems. Want to go faster? Queenstown is a mecca for adrenaline sports – the bungee jump and many more lunatic endeavours were invented here. New Zealand’s Maori culture is also fascinating and easily accessible through museums, cultural tours and homestays. This part of the world is often called Oceania, and for good reason: the South Pacific defines everything from Bondi Beach’s surfers to New Zealand’s yachties. And strung out to the north and east of New Zealand, the far-flung islands of Polynesia – settled by pioneering sailors – retain a strong seafaring culture. Most visited is Fiji, the hub of South Pacific air travel. Here there are luxury resorts a-plenty, but also many chances to experience traditional, conservative Polynesian village life. Nearby(ish) Samoa is emerging as a less-developed alternative. Tonga has world-class humpback whale-watching and the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have great diving and are home to remarkable tribal cultures. Further afield, paradise islands like Rarotonga, Tahiti and Bora Bora are firmly in luxury honeymoon territory. However, the passenger-carrying freighter Aranui is still the way to visit the remote Marquesas Islands on one of the world’s greatest and remotest boat journeys. So what are you waiting for? Start planning your Australasian adventure today…\n\n### Top 10 Australia, NZ and South Pacific travel experiences\n\nMarvel at big heads, dive with big fish, wander round big rocks – you can do it all and more down under\n\n1. __Aboriginal Arnhem Land, Australia__ – venture into this rarely visited expanse of the Northern Territory for close cultural encounters with the Aboriginal owners.\n2. __Marvel at the moai, Easter Island__ – the stone heads on this far-flung outpost of Chile are as mysterious as they are massive. Trek around the island to see the various statues: some guard the coast, others lay fallen in the massive quarry from which they were hewn.\n3. __Meet a kiwi, Stewart Island, New Zealand__ – the nocturnal and shy kiwi can be hard to spot; for your best chance head out at night with a naturalist guide on New Zealand's little-visited southern island.\n4. __Watch the land-divers, Vanuatu__ – the original bungy jump: between April and June every year some of the men of Vanuatu jump from precariously high platforms with just vines to (hopefully) break their fall.\n5. __See Sydney Harbour, Australia__ – the world's most beautiful city? Take the ferry from Circular Quay to Manly to best appreciate the marriage of bridge, opera house and ocean.\n6. __Swim with whale sharks, Western Australia__ – from March to June large numbers of pelagics visit WA's Ningaloo Reef. Dive in with whale sharks, rays and a host of other marine life.\n7. __Explore Milford Sound, New Zealand__ – the headline act of New Zealand's Fjordland, Milford is a picturesque glacier-gouged inlet, dotted with waterfalls and wildlife. Drive from Te Anau, fly in for views over the mountains en route, or walk the Milford Track to arrive on foot.\n8. __Admire Uluru (Ayers Rock), Northern Territory, Australia__ – Australia's big red rock is the big draw, but while you're in the area don't miss King's Canyon and the Olgas too; for a true-blue bush experience, camp out in a swag under the stars. \n9. __Raft the Franklin River, Tasmania, Australia__ – nearly ruined by a dam, the Franklin is a wild and wonderful waterway, best explored on a multi-day rafting trip; look out for the local wildlife as you camp by the riverbank.\n10. __Dive the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia__ – stretching for more than 2,600km along the east coast of Oz, this vast wall of coral offers great snorkelling and diving as well as island hopping (try the Whitsundays). Head to the outer reef for the best dive sites.",
